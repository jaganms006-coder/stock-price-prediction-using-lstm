# Apple Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices** using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network.  
LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for **time series forecasting**, especially financial data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical Apple stock price data
- Preprocess and normalize time series data
- Build and train an LSTM model
- Predict future stock prices
- Visualize actual vs predicted prices

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
